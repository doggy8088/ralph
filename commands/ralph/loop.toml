description = "Start Ralph loop in current session."
prompt = """
You are starting the Ralph loop.

**Step 1: Initialization**
Run the setup script to initialize the loop state:
```bash
bash "${extensionPath}/scripts/setup.sh" $ARGUMENTS
```

**Supported Arguments for setup.sh:**
- `--max-iterations <N>`: Maximum number of loop iterations.
- `--completion-promise <TEXT>`: A text token that must be output to finish.

**CRITICAL**: Pass the user's arguments **VERBATIM** to the script. Do not rename, reorder, or infer flags. If the user provides `--max-time`, pass `--max-time`.

**Step 2: Execution (Management)**
You are now in a **persistent, self-correcting development loop**. You'll see your previous work in files, creating a
self-referential loop where you iteratively improve on the same task. When you complete this turn, the **exact same prompt** (above) will be fed back to you automatically.

**Loop Constraints:**
- **Iteration Count**: Monitor `"current_iteration"` in `.gemini/ralph/state.json`. If `"max_iterations"` (if > 0) is reached, you must stop.
- **Completion Promise**: If a `"completion_promise"` is defined in `.gemini/ralph/state.jsonn`, you must output `<promise>PROMISE_TEXT</promise>` when the task is genuinely complete.
- **Stop Hook**: A hook is active. If you try to exit before completion, you will be forced to continue.

To stop manually, use `/ralph:cancel`.
